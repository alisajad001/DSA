# Data Structers and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms help us solve problems effeciently and make better apps.

## Day 01
- #### What is Algorithm?
An algorithms is a step-by-step instruction to solve a particular problem.

- #### What is Big-O notation?
Big-O notation analyzes the time and space complexity of an algorithm as its input size grows.

- #### O(n):
The time complexity of this Big-O will increase linear as input size increases.

- #### O(1):
The time complexity of this Big-O will be constant regardless of input size.

- #### O(log n):
The time complexity of this Big-O will increase slowly and cuts of the problem to half after each step.
